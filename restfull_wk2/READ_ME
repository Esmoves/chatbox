Life demo of one index.php file that opens the json file onload at http://www.wijzijncodegorilla.nl/esmeraldatijhoff/chatapp/

This chat is supposed to load messages from the databse.json upon entering the corresponding room, 
in this case room 12345.
The form in index.php activates a function in javascript, 
wich sends to the api.php which gets its data from the json file 
and sends it back to javascript. This file is supposed to fill the chatroom div in the index.php file.

Api works only directly with a link, not with the JS file (yet)
api.php?mykey=12345
